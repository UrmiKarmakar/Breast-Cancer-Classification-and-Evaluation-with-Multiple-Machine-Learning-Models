# Breast Cancer Classification and Evaluation with Multiple Machine Learning Models
This project implements multiple machine learning models to classify breast cancer cases using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. It involves data preprocessing, feature selection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation to determine the most effective approach for diagnosis.

Project Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and outlier detection
Feature Selection: Using SelectKBest to extract the most relevant features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical summaries, correlation heatmaps, and visualizations
Dimensionality Reduction: PCA for feature visualization
Model Implementation: Training and evaluating multiple ML algorithms
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and confusion matrices
Implemented Models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Na√Øve Bayes
This repository provides a comparative study of different classification models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in breast cancer detection.
