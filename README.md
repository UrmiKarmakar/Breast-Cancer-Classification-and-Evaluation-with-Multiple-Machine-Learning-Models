# Breast Cancer Classification and Evaluation with Multiple Machine Learning Models
This project focuses on classifying breast cancer using multiple machine-learning models. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset is used to train and test models, ensuring reliable predictions.

Key features:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, train-test split)
Implementation of Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Na√Øve Bayes, Neural Network, and Voting Classifier
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning for improved performance
This repository provides a structured approach to building and evaluating machine learning models for medical diagnosis.
